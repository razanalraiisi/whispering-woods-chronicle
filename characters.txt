Elara is a young girl with messy brown hair and bright green eyes. She’s curious and brave, always asking questions and exploring. When she found the old map hidden in her grandmother’s floor, she knew her adventure was about to begin.

Shadow is a quiet, dark gray wolf with soft silver eyes and sharp ears. He is fast, smart, and always stays close to Elara. She found him as a lost pup near the edge of the woods. Since then, Shadow has followed her everywhere like a silent guardian.
