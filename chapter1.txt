In the quiet village of Elderglen, tucked between misty hills and endless trees, young Elara discovered an old, rolled-up map hidden beneath the floorboards of her grandmother’s cottage. The paper was faded, its edges torn, but the strange symbols and glowing path at its center stirred something deep within her. Whispers of the nearby forest—of secrets and magic long forgotten—suddenly felt real. Clutching the map tightly, Elara knew she couldn’t ignore its call. The Whispering Woods had always been a place of fear, but now, it felt like an invitation.
