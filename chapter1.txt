In the quiet village of Elderglen, tucked between misty hills and endless trees, young Elara discovered an old, rolled-up map hidden beneath the floorboards of her grandmother’s cottage. The paper was faded, its edges torn, but the strange symbols and glowing path at its center stirred something deep within her. Whispers of the nearby forest—of secrets and magic long forgotten—suddenly felt real. Clutching the map tightly, Elara knew she couldn’t ignore its call. The Whispering Woods had always been a place of fear, but now, it felt like an invitation.

Elara sat by the fireplace that evening, the map spread out on the wooden floor in front of her. Candlelight flickered across its faded lines, and the symbols seemed to shift slightly in the glow. She traced the path drawn through the forest with her finger, pausing at a strange symbol near the edge—one that looked like an eye. A chill ran through her, but her curiosity burned brighter. The stories of the woods had always frightened her, yet something inside told her the map was calling her for a reason.

By sunrise, Elara had packed a small bag with food, a lantern, and her grandmother’s old compass. She stood quietly at the edge of the forest, where the trees loomed tall and close together. The village behind her was still and quiet, unaware of her plan. Taking a deep breath, she stepped past the boundary stone. The air grew cooler, and the forest seemed to hum with unseen life. Elara felt her heart pound, but her steps stayed steady. She didn’t know what she would find—but she knew she had to follow the path.
